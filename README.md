#the-horny-bot
discord bot to keep track of instances of people being assholish, horny, toxic, etc.

Changed on 12 Mar 2021:

Because of a recent update to textengine, the UID/UKEY functionality was here.
The port number was previously locked on 8080, but is now configurable.

Changed on 23 Mar 2021:

Made the polling feature an async function so people can't jam the horny bot by making a poll that lasts forever.
