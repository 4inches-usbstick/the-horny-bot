you can pull the alarm for the following:

horny - the original purpose
assholery - general assholery that does not fit under other categories
hate - hateful and intolerant speech
fire - starting unncessary crap
carbon-monoxide - someone being very toxic (i.e. using a logical fallacy such as ad hominem during a debate)
bullshit - promoting and pushing bullshit into people's faces (i.e. scams or excessive self promo)
illegal - illegal content or actions (i.e. porn in a server for minors / hacking)
borderline-illegal - posting content that while not illegal is unacceptable (i.e. excessive simping for people who have stated that they do not want to be simped over)
excessive - spamming, pinging excessively, etc.

and yes, the space after the '$' is required
