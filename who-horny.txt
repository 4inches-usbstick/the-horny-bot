you can pull the alarm for the following:

horny - the original purpose
assholery - general assholery that does not fit under other categories
hate - hateful and intolerant speech
fire - starting unncessary crap
carbon-monoxide - someone being very toxic (i.e. using a logical fallacy such as ad hominem during a debate)
bullshit - promoting and pushing bullshit into people's faces (i.e. scams or excessive self promo)
illegal - illegal content or actions (i.e. porn in a server for minors / hacking)
borderline-illegal - posting content that while not illegal is unacceptable (i.e. excessive simping for people who have stated that they do not want to be simped over)
excessive - spamming, pinging excessively, etc.

to pull the alarm: $ pull;<FULL-DISCORD-TAG>;<CRIME>
the <CRIME> argument must be one of the preset crimes 

to see someone's stats: $ stat;<FULL-DISCORD-TAG>;<CRIME>

to get a random index of an array: $ array;<DELIMITER>;<ITEMS SEPARATED BY DELIMITER>

to hold a poll: $ poll;<POLL-PROMPT>;<NUMBER-OF-CHOICES>:<POLL-TIME>;<CHOICE>;<CHOICE> (goes on for as many choices as is listed)

to roll the wheel: $ cgu;<user> did something (<user> replaces the ping that this randomly selected user gets, so that you can choose how to craft your sentence). use $ cgu-noping for a user id instead of ping

to see the horny log: $ log (a DM will be sent)
to see naming routings: $ nslookup (a DM will be sent)

make sure to use the person's REAL discord name when pulling or looking up a user, not their nickname
and yes, the space after the '$' is required
